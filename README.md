# Project Planning

## Project Objectives
> - Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report.
> - Create a module (wrangle.py) that make your process repeateable.
> - Construct a model to determine sources of estimate error using clustering techniques.
> - Deliver a 5 minute presentation consisting of a high-level notebook walkthrough using your Jupyter Notebook from above; your presentation should be appropriate for your target audience.
> - Answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

## Project Description
- To use unsupervised machine learning via clustering models to group similar data into a more useful form

### Project Goals
- To find out what are driving errors in Zestimates
 - 


### Executive Summary
- Key Findings
- Recommendations
- Next Steps


### Busines Goals
- To construct a ML clustering model that allows us to determine the drivers of error for Zillow Zestimates using 'logerror'.
- Document and present it a way that is clear and understandable

- Find the key sources of error for estimating the value of single family properties. Some questions that come to mind are:


- Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.

- Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in prediction these homes' values.

### Audience
- A group of managers at Zillow
- Data science team collegues 

### Project Deliverables
- Github repo with a complete readme.md, a final report (.ipynb), acquire & prepare Modules (.py) (which are in wrangle.py), other supplemental artifacts created while working on the project (e.g. exploratory/modeling notebook(s))

- A live 5 minute presentation on the notebook Report


### Data Dictionary:



### Initial Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1**
- alpha = .05


- **Hypothesis 2**
- alpha = .05





## Project Reproduction
[ ] Read the README.md file
[ ] User needs to have their own env.py file with 'user' for username, 'host', and 'password' formated like this (db, user, host, passwor) to access Codeup database 
[ ] Download the wrangle.py file into working directory for acquire and prepare functions 
[ ] Then run final_report jupyter notebook
